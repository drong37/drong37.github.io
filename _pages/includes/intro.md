# About me
  
I'm currently a PhD student supervised by [Prof Asif Usmani](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/people/academic-staff/professor-asif-sohail-usmani/) and [Prof Xinyan Huang](https://www.firelabxy.com/), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Hong Kong. I received my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree from the School of Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology. 

My research topic focuses on fire detection and control, especially about aerial remote sensing of 3D thermal mapping.
